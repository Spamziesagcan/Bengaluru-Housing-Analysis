# Bengaluru Housing Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Bengaluru housing data to provide insights into property prices and trends. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to help understand key factors influencing housing prices.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on various properties in Bengaluru, including:

- Location
- Size (BHK)
- Total Square Foot Area
- Price
- Price per Square Foot
- Availability Status
- Other relevant features

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful variables to improve analysis.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insightful graphs.
- **Price Prediction (if applicable)**: Implementing regression models to predict housing prices.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Load the `Bengaluru Housing Data Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells to explore the data and insights.

## Results

- Identified trends in Bengaluru housing prices.
- Analyzed the impact of location and size on property values.
- Developed visualizations to present key findings.

## Future Improvements

- Implement machine learning models for price prediction.
- Enhance visualizations with interactive dashboards.
- Integrate real-time data for up-to-date insights.
